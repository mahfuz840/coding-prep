Time complexities:
	- Enqueue: 
		- Regular Queue: O(1)
		- Circular Queue: O(1)
	- Dequeue:
		- Regular Queue: O(n) for array implementation, and O(1) for linked list. In some places, it is mentioned that the time complexity for this operation in a regular queue's array implementation is amortised constant time.
		- Circular Queue: O(1)
	- Front:
		- Regular Queue: O(1)
		- Circular Queue: O(1)
