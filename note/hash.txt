storing and searching data in O(1) time

Collision: when the hashed value of two keys are same.
Collision Resolution:
	- Open hashing (chaining): creating a linked list in the bucket for the keys whose hashed values are equal.
		Advantage: Deletion is easy, insertion is O(1)
		Disadvantage: searching is O(n) in worst case, extra memory usage since there can be empty slots
	- Closed hashing (Open addressing): 
		- Linear probing
			Advantage: no extra space
			Disadvantage: insertion and searching time is O(n) in worst case, deletion is difficult, primary clustering, secondary clustering
		- Quadratic probing
		- Double hashing


Load factor: # of elements/hash table size
Probe value: how many times we had to look into a position to insert a value.
