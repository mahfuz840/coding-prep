Take i-th element and compare with the elements at the right
find the min
replace if num[j] < num[i]

Complexity:
    - Uses (N^2)/2 comparisons. Time complexity is insensitive of input data, and as a result, best case and worst case are same. 
        If the data is already sorted, it still takes quadratic comparisons.
    - Uses N swap operations.
