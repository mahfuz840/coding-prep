take i-th element and compare it with the elements in the left hand side.
Swap until num[j] < num[i]

Time complexity:
    Best case (already sorted in ascending order):
        - Takes (N-1) comparisons and 0 swaps
    Worst case (sorted in the descending order):
        - Takes (N^2)/2 comparisons and swaps
